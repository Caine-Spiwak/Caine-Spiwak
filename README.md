# Background
+ Most of my working days has been as a plumber. But... I've always had an itch for entrepreneurialism. Watching my father build engines and plumbing systems from the ground up instilled a certain type of focus and attention to detail in me. Training as a plumber apprentice and eventually running my own service calls as a Technician, taught me how to operate under high stress situations, like repairing water lines on the top floor of a hospital where a small mistake could lead to flooding the whole building from the top down. 
+ During this time I have been very self-motivated, trying out many different side hustles either for additional income or in the hopes of starting a small business out of it. Most of the time I’ve “failed” but I’ve also learned many other skills in the process such as, sales, marketing, communication, leadership and more.
+ I've always had a project I was working on outside of my job. Including getting my real estate license, building dropshipping sites (wordpress & elementor), running facebook/google ads for those sites as well as for some real estate agent friends. I've ran into "coding" a few times along the way but always thought it was something I might not be capable of doing.
- __SIDE NOTE__: I'm co-founder of FLOSS BOSS RDH a small business i started with my girlfriend that brings profit every month. 🎉

# Getting Started in Web Dev
+ I was supporting my girlfirend and I while she went to school for dental hygeine. Jumping into plumbing directly after high school, I didn't feel like an 'academic education' was for me. However, I was amazed how well she was being compensated for her hard work once she graduated. I thought to myself that I wanted to bring more to the table for us and our future family so I started researching. I ran into Software Development. After some learning online (started with Python) I realzied this career path was a match made in heaven for me. I have many ideas I'd love to build, just not enough time to execute them all! I've been enjoying working with Node.js backend and React frontend.
